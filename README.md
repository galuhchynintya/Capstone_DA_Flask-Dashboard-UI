# Capstone_DA_Flask-Dashboard-UI
Capstone Project Data Analytics Flask Dashboard UI
In this capstone, you are asked to build a simple UI using **Flask** which contains several plot displays from the skeleton provided and one additional plot based on your analysis.

This file can be used to help you in the wrangling and visualization process. If the wrangling process is correct and the visualization results are in accordance with the provisions, you can move the program code that you have completed back into the `app.py` file.

**1. Create a virtual environment named `capstone-flask`**

The first thing to do is set up the conda environment. To prepare the conda environment and kernel, please use the following command:

```
conda create -n capstone-flask python=3.10
conda activate capstone-flask
```

**2. Install the required libraries: `pandas`, `flask`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy`**

All dependencies have been exported into the requirements.txt file. Therefore, to install the library, you can use the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt --user
```

**3. Data Cleansing**

**4. Data Wrangling**
